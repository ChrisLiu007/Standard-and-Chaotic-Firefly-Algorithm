# Standard-and-Chaotic-Firefly-Algorithm
MATLAB implementations of standard and chaos-incorporated versions of the firefly metaheuristic tested on continuous optimization functions. The firefly algorithm (FA) is a swarm intelligence based metaheuristic used for mathematical optimization, inspired by the movement and attraction of fireflies in nature.

**main_firefly_cont.m** - Standard FA with damping applied on the randomization parameter.
**main_cfa_cont.m** - Chaotic FA with Gaussian map applied on the attractiveness coefficient.
**main_cfa_cont_2.m** - Chaotic FA with Logistic map applied on the light absorption coefficient and randomization parameter.

The Booth, Goldstien-Price, Levi N.13, Griewank, Sphere function are also implemented in separate files to be used as the objective function.
